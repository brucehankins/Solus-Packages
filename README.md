# Solus-Packages
The pupose of this github is to learn how to use git, improve CLI ability, and learn packaging for Solus.
All code hosted on this page will be pulled from other sources that fall under opensource and have opensource licenses attached to them. I am not a programmer, so no changes to source code will be made
This is solely to learn to repackage software I find useful that is not currently available through snap, flatpak, or on in the Solus repos into a .eopkg for use on a local repository.
Any feedback is welcome, if you have any tips or tricks please let me know!
