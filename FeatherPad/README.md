FeatherPad (by Pedram Pourang, a.k.a. Tsu Jan tsujan2000@gmail.com) is a lightweight Qt plain-text editor for Linux. It is independent of any desktop environment. 

The code for this application has not been modified in any way and has only been repackaged to an .eopkg format for use with Solus and other PiSi/eopkg Linux distributions. 

Original source code can be found at https://github.com/tsujan/FeatherPad and version used to build can be pulled from https://github.com/tsujan/FeatherPad/releases/tag/V0.18.0 

If there are any issues with the package build please let me know. If there is any issue or bug directly related to the app itself please reach out to the original dev team.
