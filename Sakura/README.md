Sakura, a simple but powerful libvte based terminal emulator.

Sakura is a terminal emulator and it's only dependencies are GTK and VTE. It uses a notebook to provide several terminals in one window and allows to change configuration options via a contextual menu. No more no less.

The code for this application has not been modified in any way and has only been repackaged to an .eopkg format for use with Solus and other PiSi/eopkg Linux distributions.

If there are any issues with the package build please let me know. If there is any issue or bug directly related to the app itself please reach out to the original dev team.
