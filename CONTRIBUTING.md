# Contributing 
First off, thanks for taking the time to visit my page and contribute!

I'm just starting out, and for some reason decided to try and learn GitHub, git CLI, and Linux packaging all at one time. So come along and have some fun on this crazy ride. This is all for learning for fun, and I greatly appreciate all the feedback and support that I receive. _Did I mention I just figured out how to use markdown to create this document?_

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to my repository and its packages. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

_**I don't want to read this whole thing I just have a question!**_

**Note**: Please don't file an issue to ask a question. You'll get faster results by using the resources below. Issues created to ask a question will be closed without response.

I will be working on a FAQ and where the community can chime in with helpful advice. If you have you have a question, or would just like to chat, feel free to contact me.

## What you should know before starting
### What this is

This is a passion project for me. Who knows where it will lead to, but for now, its a way for me to learn about using GitHub, git in the command line, packaging for Solus, and just generally more about Linux.

### What it’s not

This is not a main source for packages or files to install for yourself. This is not the place to find the source code or all the details of an application package hosted here. All files, packages, and other data hosted on this repository will be updated at my discretion. Old, unpatched, and unmaintained files can break and can break your system. If you want to use the information here to compile, build, or install anything, you do so at your own risk.

### Packaging Information

This repository is for packaging with an intention of being deployed on Solus. As such, all packages and packaging files are generated using frameworks, tooling, and practices developed by the Solus team. You can read more about the packaging practices, find useful help, and read documentation at https://getsol.us/articles/packaging/. 

## How can I contribute?
This is a learning exercise for me, so there are many ways that you can help and contribute. You can submit bug reports, suggest enhancements, or point out areas for improvement or optimization

### Bug Reports

Understand that I am not a programmer, I didn’t write the source code used, and I’m merely repackaging for use with a very specific package manager on a very specific Linux distribution.

### General Bug Reporting Guidelines

* Determine the package you are having issues with and the source of the original code
* Perform a cursory search to see if the problem has been reported on another distribution or if it’s a known bug by the original developer
* If the bug is with the packaging files or packaging process itself, please file a report through the issues section

**Provide more context by including the following information**

* Which version of the package are you using?
* Did the problem start happening after a recent OS update?
* Which OS, Desktop Environment, and Version are you using?
* Is this a Virtual Machine or is your system installed to metal?

## Packages
Is there a package that you would like included on this repository? Let me know, reach out through Telegram or Twitter, the contact information is listed above and in the README.md

Want to submit a package? Use the Pull Request and it will be reviewed, and if accepted, merged with the main branch.
